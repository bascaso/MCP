MCP (Matching Catalogues and Computing Completeness and Purity rates)



Description

The MCP is a python package that matches one list of structures (e.g dark matter haloes) to other (e.g. cluster detections) using Cylindrical Matching and FoF+Cylindrical Matching. 

Additionally, if requested, the program will compute completeness and purity rates.
